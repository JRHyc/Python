# Multiples
# Part I - Write code that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000. Use the for loop and don't use a list to do this exercise.
for one in range(1,1000, 2):
    print one

# Part II - Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.

for two in range(5, 1000000, 5):
    print two

# Sum List + Average List
# Create a program that prints the sum of all the values in the list:    
a = [1, 2, 5, 10, 255, 3] 
print sum(a)
print sum(a)/len(a)
